# 2_data_analysis – Refugee Higher Education

This folder provides **quick, lightweight insights** into refugee access to higher education.  
The goal is to turn basic numbers from UNHCR and other sources into **simple tables and visuals** that show where the largest enrolment gaps occur.

---

## What This Folder Does

- Tracks **enrolment patterns** across primary → secondary → tertiary levels  
- Highlights the **sharp drop** at the university stage  
- Prepares **clean charts and summary tables** for use in reports and presentations  
- Organises data so the team can spot trends without heavy statistics

## Files

### `summary_table.xlsx`
Contains the core indicators:
- Enrolment rates by level  
- Changes in tertiary enrolment over time  
- Compact notes on sources  

Used as the base file for all visualisations.

### Image Files
Visual assets that show:
- Enrolment levels side-by-side  
- The tertiary education gap  
- Simple graphics taken or adapted from reports  

These visuals feed directly into the final results section.

## Why This Folder Matters
The analysis here gives the project:
- A **numerical snapshot** of where refugee students are being left behind  
- Evidence that supports our later arguments and recommendations  
- Reusable visuals for presentations, dashboards, and documentation  

This folder doesn’t create new data — it **clarifies and amplifies** what existing data already shows.
