# Research Project: Access to Higher Education for Refugee Youth

## 1. Research Focus

Refugee and displaced youth face significant challenges in accessing higher
education, not only due to financial, legal, and language barriers, but also
because information about scholarships and support programs is often fragmented
and difficult to navigate. This project focuses on how data science and
AI-assisted approaches can help organize existing information and highlight
practical opportunities that support refugee access to higher education.

The study focuses on:
- Identifying key information gaps that limit access to higher education
- Understanding common barriers such as funding, documentation, and language
- Mapping existing scholarships, NGO programs, and online learning pathways
- Exploring how AI-assisted tools could connect refugee learners with suitable
  higher education opportunities


## 2. Key Concepts 

- **Refugee youth** – young people (about 15–29) who have been forced to
 leave their country and are living in a host country or in displacement.
- **Higher education** – universities, colleges, technical institutes, 
and other post-secondary programs.
- **Barriers** – financial cost, legal status, missing documents, language
 of instruction, interrupted schooling, digital access.
- **Support programs** – scholarships, NGO and UN programs, connected/online
 learning, mentoring, psychosocial support.


## 3. Background & Reference Materials


- [**UNHCR – Higher Education and Skills**](https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/education/higher-education-and-skills)  
  - Global overview of refugee access to higher education, noting that
   only about **7%** of refugees reach tertiary education.  
  - Describes key barriers (financial, legal, language, digital) and 
  support pathways such as scholarships and connected learning.

- [**UNHCR – 15by30 Higher-Education Roadmap**](https://www.unhcr.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/15by30-roadmap.pdf)  
  - Strategy to expand refugee higher-education enrolment from ~7% 
  to **15% by 2030**, across five main pathways (national systems, 
  scholarships, connected learning, TVET, self-reliance).  
  - Provides concrete actions for governments, universities, and NGOs
   to coordinate efforts.

- [**DAFI – UNHCR Tertiary Scholarship Programme for Refugees**](https://www.unhcr.org/what-we-do/build-better-futures/education/higher-education-and-skills/dafi-tertiary-scholarship-0)  
  - One of the main global scholarship schemes funding refugee 
  students in undergraduate programmes in their country of asylum.  
  - Covers tuition and basic living costs and pairs financial aid 
  with mentoring and academic support.

- [**IOM – Feasibility Study on Higher-Education Scholarships for Refugees**](https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl486/files/documents/ERN%2Bfeasibility-study-Higher-Education-Scholarships-for-Refugees.pdf)  
  - Analytical report comparing in-country, third-country, and 
  online scholarship models for refugees.  
  - Identifies design lessons, risks, and good practices for 
  building effective, scalable scholarship pathways.

- [**Tertiary Education for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon**](https://www.aub.edu.lb/ifi/Documents/publications/policy_briefs/2018-2019/20190402_tertiary_education_syrian_refugees_lebanon.pdf)  
  - Policy brief on financial, legal, and language barriers that 
  Syrian refugees face when trying to enter Lebanese universities.  
  - Includes enrolment figures and highlights gaps in existing 
  scholarship and support programmes.

- [**Syrian Refugee Students in Lebanese Higher Education: Recognition of Qualifications and Beyond**](https://www.aub.edu.lb/ifi/Documents/publications/research_reports/2019-2020/20190107_syrian_refugee_students_in_lebanese_higher_education.pdf)  
  - Research report focused on documentation and 
  qualification-recognition issues for Syrian refugee students.  
  - Provides data tables and case analysis showing how missing or 
  unrecognised credentials block access to higher education.


## 4. Technical Approach
Our approach is focused on combining desk research with a 
small, simple dataset. We will:

- Map the main barriers and support programs for refugee youth 
using a few core sources (UNHCR, DAFI, MIT ReACT).
- Build a small illustrative dataset (e.g., region, main barrier, 
type of support, short note on impact) from public information or a tiny survey.
- Use basic descriptive analysis (simple counts and one or two charts)
 to show which barriers and supports appear most often.
- Reflect on what these patterns mean for refugee access to higher 
education and where important gaps remain.
