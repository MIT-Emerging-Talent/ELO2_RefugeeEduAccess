# Final Summary – Bridging the Gap: Higher Education for Refugee Youth

This folder contains the final results of our capstone project  
**“Bridging the Gap: Higher Education for Refugee Youth.”**

The main public artifact is our PowerPoint presentation, which gives a clear
story of the problem, the barriers, the existing support programmes, and our
recommendations.

## 1. Original Goal

Our original goal was to:

- Map **systemic barriers** to higher education for refugee youth (especially in Lebanon).
- Analyse **existing support programmes** (scholarships, NGOs, online learning, bridging programmes).
- Identify **gaps and opportunities** to make access to higher education more fair.

---

## 2. The Problem

- Less than **5%** of refugee youth access higher education.  
- For Lebanese youth, less than **30%** access higher education.  
- Refugee youth face many **interlocking barriers**:
  - financial
  - legal
  - academic
  - digital
  - psychosocial  

When refugee youth cannot continue their studies, this leads to **lost
potential** and makes cycles of displacement even harder to break.

## 3. Key Barriers (from our study)

- **Financial**  
  - Tuition and fees  
  - Living costs  
  - Lost income for the family

- **Legal and documentation**  
  - Residency and paperwork problems  
  - Work restrictions for students

- **Academic**  
  - Language mismatch  
  - Unrecognised prior schooling

- **Digital**  
  - No devices or weak internet  
  - Low digital skills

- **Psychosocial**  
  - Trauma and stress  
  - No mentors  
  - Unclear pathways to university  

---

## 4. Existing Supports

From our domain study and slides, we highlight:

- **Scholarships**  
  - DAFI, HOPES, and other NGO-funded scholarships.

- **NGOs and organisations**  
  - Caritas, SPARK, Jusoor and others working with refugee students.

- **Online / connected learning**  
  - Platforms such as Coursera for Refugees and similar initiatives.

- **Bridging programmes**  
  - Language courses  
  - Academic preparation  
  - Support programmes that help students move from school to university.  

These supports help, but they are **not enough** to reach all refugee youth who
could succeed in higher education.

## 5. Our Recommendations

Based on our research and small data analysis, we suggest:

1. **Create central information portals**  
   - One clear place where refugee youth can find information about
     scholarships, programmes, and rules.

2. **Advocate for legal work options for students**  
   - Allow refugee students to work in safe and fair ways while they study.

3. **Expand blended and online learning**  
   - Provide devices and internet access.  
   - Use blended models (online + local support).

4. **Design holistic bridging programmes**  
   - Combine language, academic skills, psychosocial support, and mentoring.
