🎯 **MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2 Project**

*Bridging Refugee Access to Higher Education with Data Science and AI*

---

## Project Overview

This project looks at the main challenges that prevent refugee and displaced
youth from accessing higher education, including financial, legal, and language
barriers. Instead of only describing these difficulties, the project focuses on
how technology can help turn challenges into opportunities.

It examines how AI-assisted matching tools could connect refugee students with
suitable scholarships and academic pathways based on their needs and
background. The goal is to move beyond identifying disadvantages and toward
developing practical, scalable digital approaches that support greater access
to higher education for refugees worldwide.


## Research Questions

1. What barriers and information gaps limit refugee youth in the world from
   accessing higher education opportunities?

2. What higher education support programs currently exist, and where do gaps in
   accessibility and awareness remain?

3. How can data science and AI-assisted tools help connect refugee learners with
   more suitable scholarships and academic pathways?


## Planned Structure of the Repository

We use a simple five-folder structure:

- [`0_domain_study/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess/tree/main/0_domain_study) – Background research and
  literature review (context, key sources)

- [`1_dataset/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess/tree/main/1_datasets) – Main dataset(s) used in the project,
  including public statistics and small survey data

- [`2_data_analysis/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess/tree/main/2_data_analysis) – Notebooks and notes for
  data cleaning, exploration, and analysis

- [`3_final_results/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess/tree/main/3_final_results) – Final report, key figures,
  tables, and presentation slides

- [`collaboration/`](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ELO2_RefugeeEduAccess/tree/main/collaboration) – Project planning
